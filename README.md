# web-scraping-challenge
Overall, I would say this was a very tough assignment. It is still not clear to me the best way to parse an HTML to find the elements neccesary. It seems like this subject needed more than just a weeks time, and more examples of different websites to learn different HTML schema. 

### 1. Jupyter NB
#### Nasa Mars News
I first set this up, and then the code only worked intermittenly. After spending an hour with someone from AskBCS, we finally figured out how to get this working in the jupyter book. 

#### Mars Weather - Twitter
This was a beast. After googling a bunch all I could find was how to use the Twitter API. I did eventually get it to work.

### 2. Flask
I set up the scraper app, flask app, and the index.html. 

After many hours I could not get this to work. There is some issue with the cache that is beyond my capabilities to fix. I cannot for the life of me understand why some code would work in the jupyter nb and not in the scrape_mars.py.

Having already spent ~25 hours on this and an hour with AskBCS, I sadly have no more time to devote to figuring this out.

I did include a .pdf of the flask html landing page, even if it is empty.
